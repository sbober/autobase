/* 
  Groovy script for migration @AUTHOR@ / @ID@

  Changes here are applied to the database.  Changes to this file will cause 
  it to be reapplied unless the MD5 is explicitly set or explicitly ignored.  
  See Liquibase documentation at http://www.liquibase.org/manual for info on 
  how to do that.

  If you want to access a file in the project, use the fileOpener.  This will
  guaranty that it works both in the WAR and in the project structure.

  For Liquibase API details, see http://www.liquibase.org/api/index.html

  Available objects:
    db              liquibase.database.Database
    sql             groovy.sql.Sql
    fileOpener      liquibase.FileOpener
    changeSet       liquibase.ChangeSet
    sourceFile      String (sourceFile parameter from migration)
    logicalName     String (logical name of the source file)
